Important Note: the master branch has all the components added together, as most of the components were added to it on just after the initial commit. The product components will be neatly segregated into respective branches, since these are prototypes and will be improved. An initial stable release will be confirmed by our team if possible, during which the entire product suite will be available in the master branch.

Thank you for visiting this repository! Below is an introduction to the project.

This project is started for a social cause: Developing and bolstering social diversity at workplace, the needs for which are well documented in our proposal / pitch file.

The project comprises of a smart enterprise platform designed to promote workplace diversity through gamified team building. The users for this product will be companies / organizations / enterprises.

There are 3 main components to this project
1) A Mobile Application - Main interface / platform for all users of the system (all employees in a company)
2) A Web Application - For configuring and maintaining the platform, typically to be used by company administrators.
3) A data analysis and machine intelligence unit, which will be extended and maintained by our team for continuous improvement of the platform, which will also be the entry point for improving workflows and adding automations to the platform, as well as for incorporating a business intelligence feature in future for eventually reducing the need for maintainence of this platform by the Admins.

1) The Mobile App is a cross platform react-native mobile app [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). The Mobile App prototype is available in the mobile_app branch.

2) The Web App is a PHP application hosted on Heroku Cloud serving requests for the supported Admin functions.

3) The data analysis unit is a python application included within the repository as a script, further data analysis work performed using R is also included.
